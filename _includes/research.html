                <h2>GREENHOUSE GAS MONITORING AND CARBON NEUTRALITY</h2>
                <p><small>To mitigate climate change, we quantify greenhouse gas emissions and sinks and develop science-based pathways toward carbon neutrality. Using satellite observations and artificial intelligence, we estimate carbon emissions and sinks across public institutions, industries, and national systems. We further assess long-term trends and evaluate mitigation strategies to support effective climate policy and decision-making.</small></p>

                <h2>RENEWABLE ENERGY OPTIMIZATION</h2>
                <p><small>Renewable energy is no longer optional but essential for achieving carbon neutrality. We develop advanced forecasting techniques to optimize renewable energy systems by integrating numerical modeling and artificial intelligence. Our research focuses on predicting the supply and demand of wind and solar power to enhance efficiency, reliability, and grid stability.</small></p>

                <h2>EXTREME WEATHER AND CLIMATE PREDICTION</h2>
                <p><small>As climate change intensifies, extreme weather and climate events are becoming more frequent and severe. We develop advanced prediction technologies for typhoons, heatwaves, cold surges, floods, and droughts by integrating satellite observations, numerical models, and artificial intelligence. Our research aims to enhance forecasting accuracy and improve preparedness for climate-related hazards.</small></p>

                <h2>CLIMATE RISK ASSESSMENT</h2>
                <p><small>To protect ourselves from climate change, we must first understand the risks we face. We assess physical climate risks affecting both private enterprises and the public sector. Our research supports the development of effective risk management and adaptation strategies to enhance climate resilience.</small></p>

                <p><small>While the climate crisis is accelerating, the pace of mitigation efforts remains limited. We evaluate the effectiveness, sustainability, and potential side effects of emerging climate intervention technologies that may complement conventional carbon reduction strategies. Our research provides scientific evidence to assess their feasibility and long-term implications.</small></p>
